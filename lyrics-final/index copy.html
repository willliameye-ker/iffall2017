		<h3>[Intro: SHARPAY (Spoken)]</h3>
		<p>
			It’s out with the old and in with the new
			<br>
			Goodbye clouds of gray, hello skies of blue
			<br>
			A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa
			<br>
			Endless days in my chaise, the whole world according to moi
			<br>
			(Excuse me? Thank you)</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

		<h3>[Verse 1: SHARPAY]</h3>
			<p>Iced tea imported from England
			<br>
			Lifeguards imported from Spain
			<br>
			Towels imported from Turkey
			<br>
			And turkey imported from Maine </p>
			<br>

		<h3>[Verse 2: SHARPAY]</h3>
			<p>Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops
			<br>
			Where is my pink Prada tote?
			<br>
			I need my Tiffany hairband

			And then I can go for a float</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
