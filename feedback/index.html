I reviewed Sherry Xu's webpage mockup. She combines images of famed author Oscar Wilde with some of his inspirational quotes. She has a distinct aesthetic of old photographs combined with a handwritten font. The font and images work well together, but I recommended finding a handwritten web font. I thought that a font with more texture and line width could better convey the handwritten nature of the quotes. I also recommended that all of her photos be either in sepia or gray instead of a combination, so the images seem more visually linked. In addition, the font was a bright white, and the letters themselves seemed too close together. I recommended making the letters a light gray and adding more space in between letters, so they could be more readable on a screen. The contrast of the fold and the images became a little too distracting, so adjusting that would be more effective.
