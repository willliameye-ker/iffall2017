	<p>It's out with the old and in with the new</p>
	<p>Goodbye clouds of gray, hello skies of blue </p>
	<p>A dip in the pool, a trip to the spa</p>
	<p>Endless days in my chaise </p>
	<p>The whole world according to moi</p>
	<br>
	<p>Excuse me?</p>
	<p>Thank you</p>
	<br>
	<p>Iced tea imported from England</p>
	<p>Lifeguards imported from Spain</p>
	<p>Towels imported from Turkey</p>
	<p>And Turkey imported from Maine</p>
	<p>We're gonna relax and renew</p>
	<p>You go do </p>

	<div class="chorus"> 
	<p>I want fabulous that is my simple request</p>
	<p>All things fabulous, bigger and better and best</p>
	<p>I need something inspiring to help me get along</p>
	<p>I need a little fabulous, is that so wrong</p> 
	</div>
	</center>
	<center>
	<br>
	<p>Fetch me my Jimmy Choo flip-flops </p>
	<p>Where is my pink Prada tote?</p>
	<p>I need my Tiffany hairband</p>
	<p>And then I can go for a float</p>
	<p>Summer like never before</p>
	<p>I want more</p>
	<br>
	<div class="chorus"> 
	<p>I want fabulous that is my simple request</p>
	<p>All things fabulous, bigger and better and best</p>

	<br>
	<p>Fabulous pool, fabulous splash</p>
	<p>Fabulous parties even fabulous trash</p>
	<p>Fabulous fashion, fabulous bling</p>

	<p>Nothing to discuss</p>
	<p>Everything's got to be perfect for me</p>

	<p>This won't do, that's a bore</p>
	<p>That's insulting, I need more</p>
	<p>I need, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need</p>
	<p>I need fabulous</p>
	<p>Give me fabulous hair, fabulous style</p>
	<p>Fabulous eyes and that fabulous smile</p>
	<p>Oh, I like what I see, I like it a lot</p>
	<p>Is this absolutely fabulous?</p>
	<p>Absolutely not</p>
